Odin Project: HTML Project Recipes
Up until this point of the project, I have been exposed to a couple of exercises using different terminal commands, setting up a repository in github, and an introduction to some HTML tags. Also, I have been introduced to git commands (add, commit, push) to update the repository and have backups on every iteration.
