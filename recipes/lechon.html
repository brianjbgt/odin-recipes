    <p>Lechon is pork dish that is really popular in the Philippines. Its main characteristics
        are the crunchy skin and the tender juicy meat. Mix it with a little sauce on the side 
        and you'll never stop eating it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Belly</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>White Vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, garlic, salt, vinegar, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the pork belly on a cutting board skin-side down. Use a sharp knife to score the flesh diagonally about every 2-inches, and then repeat in the opposite direction to create a diamond pattern. Spread the garlic mixture all over the flesh.</li>
        <li>Roll the pork into a cylinder shape and tie it tightly with butcher twine at one-inch intervals.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill. Once hot, place the pork belly on the grill and secure it so it doesn’t slide off.</li>
        <li>Cover, and cook the pork over medium heat until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the pork reaches 160°F and the skin is dark and crisp. This will take approximately 3 hours.</li>
        <li>When the pork is done, remove it from the grill and let it rest for 10 minutes before removing it from the grill. Slice and serve with your favorite sides.</li>
    </ol>
